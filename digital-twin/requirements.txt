# OMEGA PLATFORM - DIGITAL TWIN CYBER-SIMULATION ENGINE DEPENDENCIES
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file lists all core Python packages required for the Digital Twin
# microservice. It reflects a sophisticated environment for scientific computing,
# agent-based modeling, machine learning (including GPU acceleration), and
# high-performance inter-service communication.
#
# --- Core Scientific Computing & Data Handling ---
numpy==1.26.2
scipy==1.11.3
pandas==2.1.2
pyarrow==14.0.1 # For efficient data serialization/deserialization

# --- Simulation & Agent-Based Modeling ---
mesa==2.2.1        # Agent-based modeling framework
simpy==4.0.1       # Discrete-event simulation
networkx==3.2.1    # Graph theory for network topology modeling

# --- AI / Machine Learning (with GPU Acceleration) ---
# Use tensorflow-gpu or torch-cuda for GPU acceleration if available.
# Otherwise, pip will install the CPU-only version.
tensorflow==2.15.0 # Google's Deep Learning Framework (install with GPU support for max perf)
keras==2.15.0      # Deep learning API for TensorFlow
# torch==2.1.0      # PyTorch (alternative DL framework)
# torchvision==0.16.0
# torchaudio==2.1.0
scikit-learn==1.3.2 # Traditional ML algorithms for anomaly detection, classification
gymnasium==0.29.1  # Successor to OpenAI Gym for Reinforcement Learning environments
stable-baselines3==2.2.1 # Advanced RL algorithms (PPO, A2C, SAC, etc.)
# If specific GPU versions are needed, consider platform-specific requirements.
# e.g., tensorflow-gpu (often tied to CUDA versions)

# --- Data Validation & Settings Management ---
pydantic==2.5.0    # Data validation and settings management using Python type hints
pydantic-settings==2.1.0 # For managing application settings with Pydantic

# --- Communication & Interfacing ---
grpcio==1.59.0     # gRPC core library for high-performance RPC
grpcio-tools==1.59.0 # gRPC tools for protobuf compilation
websockets==12.0   # For real-time bi-directional communication (e.g., with AR/VR layer)
requests==2.31.0   # Robust HTTP client for external API calls
protobuf==4.25.1   # Google's Protocol Buffers

# --- Database & Persistence ---
sqlalchemy==2.0.23 # ORM for interacting with databases
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9 # PostgreSQL adapter for SQLAlchemy
alembic==1.12.1    # Database migration tool for SQLAlchemy

# --- Logging & Utilities ---
structlog==23.2.0  # Structured logging for better observability
python-dotenv==1.0.0 # For loading environment variables
pyyaml==6.0.1      # YAML parser/emitter for configuration

# --- Development & Testing Tools (often in a separate dev requirements file) ---
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-cov==4.1.0
flake8==6.1.0
black==23.10.1
isort==5.12.0
mypy==1.6.1
pre-commit==3.5.0
jupyterlab==4.0.9  # For interactive development and data exploration

# --- Unreal Engine Bridge Specific (as indicated by unreal_bridge.py) ---
# These are often part of a custom Python environment provided by Unreal,
# or specific packages needed to interface with Unreal's Python API.
# The exact packages depend heavily on the Unreal version and bridge implementation.
# For now, listing placeholders for common types of interaction.
# unreal_engine_api # Placeholder: this is usually provided by the UE Python API itself
# python_ue_bridge # Custom library for a specific Unreal bridge implementation

# --- Security & Crypto ---
# cryptography==41.0.7 # General cryptographic primitives
# pyca-cryptography # More comprehensive
# (Specific quantum-safe crypto libs would be added here based on choice)
