# Intelligence Core Module

## Overview
The `intelligence-core` module is the brain of the Omega ecosystem, responsible for predictive defense capabilities. It integrates advanced AI/ML models to anticipate threats, analyze patterns, and recommend countermeasures.

## Key Features
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modeling attacker networks and attack paths.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic zero-day attack simulations.
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive defense strategies.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human attacker behavior and understanding natural language threat intelligence.

## Technologies Used
- Python (for AI/ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Julia (for high-performance numerical and scientific computing)

## Design Principles
- Predictive: Focus on anticipating threats before they materialize.
- Adaptive: Continuously learns and evolves defense strategies.
- Scalable: Designed to handle large volumes of data and complex models.
