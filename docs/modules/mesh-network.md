# Mesh Network Module

## Overview
The `mesh-network` module forms the distributed communication backbone for all Omega agents. It enables secure, resilient, and decentralized peer-to-peer messaging, consensus mechanisms, and event streaming across the ecosystem.

## Key Features
- Distributed P2P messaging for agent-to-agent communication.
- Consensus protocols for shared state and decision-making.
- High-throughput event streaming for threat intelligence and operational data.
- Resilient to network partitions and node failures.

## Technologies Used
- Go (for efficient network programming and concurrency)
- Elixir (for high-availability, fault-tolerance, and distributed systems)

## Design Principles
- Decentralization: No single point of failure.
- Scalability: Designed to support a large number of agents.
- Security: Encrypted communication and authenticated peers.
